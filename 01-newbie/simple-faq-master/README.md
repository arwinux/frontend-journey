<!-- OVERVIEW -->

## Overview

This project is a responsive FAQ (Frequently Asked Questions) page built as a solution to the devChallenges.io Simple FAQ challenge. The page features a clean, modern design with a dark starry background and a centered white content area containing frequently asked questions and their detailed answers.

The design includes:

- A prominent "Frequently Asked Questions" title
- A subtitle explaining the purpose
- Two detailed FAQ sections with proper formatting
- Responsive design that works across desktop, tablet, and mobile devices
- Custom typography using Inter font family
- Smooth hover effects and modern styling

### What I learned

While building this FAQ page, I reinforced several key web development concepts:

- **CSS Custom Properties**: Implemented a comprehensive CSS variables system for consistent theming across the project
- **CSS Import Organization**: Structured CSS files with proper imports for better maintainability (reset.css, variables.css, typography.css, main.css)
- **Responsive Design**: Created a layout that adapts well to different screen sizes using flexible units and proper spacing
- **Typography Management**: Set up custom font families and implemented proper font loading with fallbacks
- **CSS Grid and Flexbox**: Used modern CSS layout techniques for centering content and creating responsive layouts
- **Semantic HTML**: Structured the content with proper semantic elements for better accessibility and SEO

The project helped me practice creating clean, maintainable CSS architecture and reinforced the importance of proper file organization in web development projects.
